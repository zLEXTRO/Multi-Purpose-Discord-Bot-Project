# Imperial Discord Bot

Welcome to the Imperial Discord Bot repository! This repository showcases the code of my upcomming Discord bot, Imperial. It's an ambitious project aimed at creating a comprehensive multi-purpose bot designed to enhance the Discord experience. Currently equipped with essential moderation tools, Imperial is on a path of continuous development to integrate a wide array of features.

**Please note**: The code and features in this repository are subject to change as the bot evolves. Additionally, inviting Imperial to your own server is not currently possible until it is properly set up and has a sufficient feature set to ensure a great user experience and proper hosting. The code provided is a preview, demonstrating the implementation of the commands and is not the final version.

## Current Features
-**Slash Commands**
-**SYNC**: synchronize new commands
- **tempmute**: Temporarily silence members to maintain order in your channels.
- **Banlist**: Get user IDs of members in the banlist.
- **Unmute**: unmute members.
- **Kick Members**: punish bad behavior by throwing members out of the Server.
- **Ban Members**: Keep your server safe by banning disruptive members.
- **Unban Members**: Allow members another chance by lifting bans when appropriate.
- **Purge Messages**: Clean up your chat by bulk-deleting messages quickly and efficiently.

## --NEW-- [UPDATE #2]
- **Code Improvements**
-**Instructions**: How to Setup your Bot (find put bellow)
