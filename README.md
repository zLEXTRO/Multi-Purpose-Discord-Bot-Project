# Multi-Purpose-Discord-Bot-Project-Imperial

Welcome to the Imperial Discord Bot repository! This repository showcases the code of my private Discord bot, Imperial. It's an ambitious project aimed at creating a comprehensive multi-purpose bot designed to enhance the Discord experience. Currently equipped with essential moderation tools, Imperial is on a path of continuous development to integrate a wide array of features.

**Please note**: The code and features in this repository are subject to change as the bot evolves. Additionally, inviting Imperial to your own server is not currently possible until it is properly set up and has a sufficient feature set to ensure a great user experience. The code provided is a preview, demonstrating the implementation of the commands and is not the final version.


## Current Features
- **Ban Members**: Keep your server safe by banning disruptive members.
- **Unban Members**: Allow members another chance by lifting bans when appropriate.
- **Mute Members**: Temporarily silence members to maintain order in your channels.
- **Purge Messages**: Clean up your chat by bulk-deleting messages quickly and efficiently.

## Upcoming Features
- **Voice Channel (VC) Support**: Manage and interact with voice channels in innovative ways.
- **AI Support**: Harness the power of artificial intelligence for auto-moderation, user engagement, and more.

- **MUCH MORE!**: a wide range of Features from moderation, to Entertainment, all the way to Artificial Intelligence.

Imperial is more than just a bot.
It's a community-driven project that grows with your support and feedback. Stay tuned for updates as we expand Imperial's capabilities and redefine what a Discord bot can do!
